# delivery-forecasting-and-KPIs-dashboard-PowerBI_MySQL

This project analyzes a comprehensive food delivery dataset using SQL and Power BI to extract actionable insights on delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. It explores key factors such as delivery times, ratings, vehicle condition, traffic density, weather, festival impact, and peak hours.

Advanced SQL techniquesâ€”including recursive date generation and predictive queriesâ€”support real-time decision-making, while the interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes KPIs across cities, time slots, and delivery conditions.

The goal is to help delivery companies optimize operations, reduce delays, and enhance customer experience through data-driven strategies.

## Business Problem

In the highly competitive food delivery industry, timely deliveries and high customer satisfaction are critical. Companies face challenges including:

- Delays due to traffic, weather, or vehicle conditions.
- Variations in delivery performance across cities and delivery personnel.
- Managing peak demand periods efficiently.
- Predicting late deliveries to proactively manage customer expectations.
- Understanding the impact of external factors like festivals and weather on delivery efficiency.

Addressing these issues helps reduce delivery time, improve customer ratings, and optimize resource allocation.

---

## Solution & Approach

To solve these problems, this project uses **SQL-based exploratory data analysis and predictive queries** on delivery datasets, focusing on:

- Tracking delivery ratings and performance over time.
- Comparing average delivery times across different cities, vehicle conditions, and traffic levels.
- Identifying popular order types and frequent delivery locations.
- Analyzing delivery delays during festivals and peak hours.
- Using recursive CTEs to generate complete daily delivery counts, even for days with no orders.
- Segmenting delivery times into buckets and categorizing traffic and weather conditions to predict late deliveries.
- Ranking delivery personnel by their efficiency and ratings to recognize top performers.

This data-driven approach helps businesses optimize delivery logistics, plan for high-demand periods, and enhance customer experience through improved operational insights.

##  Sample DAX Measures

``DAX
Average Delivery Time = AVERAGE('Orders'[Delivery_Time])
On-Time Percentage = DIVIDE([On-Time Orders], [Total Orders], 0)
Late Deliveries = CALCULATE([Total Orders], 'Orders'[Status] = "Late")



##  Sample Insights

-  **70.85%** of on-time deliveries receive higher customer ratings.
-  **6PMâ€“Midnight** is the busiest delivery window and the most delay-prone.
-  Deliveries made during **Jam traffic + Foggy weather** conditions face up to a **76% delay rate**.

---

##  Limitations

-  **70.85%** of on-time deliveries receive higher customer ratings.
-  **6PMâ€“Midnight** is the busiest delivery window and the most delay-prone.
-  Deliveries made during **Jam traffic + Foggy weather** conditions face up to a **76% delay rate**.
- The dataset does **not include financial or operational costs**.
- Forecasting is based on **historical delivery trends**, not real-time data.
- Customer feedback is limited to **star ratings only**, lacking qualitative insights.
